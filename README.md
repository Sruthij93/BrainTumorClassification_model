# Brain Tumor Classification ML model

This project leverages advanced deep learning techniques to assist in the diagnosis of brain tumors using MRI scans. It aims to classify tumors into four categories: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors, or no tumor, providing an interactive interface for users, including patients and medical professionals.

## Tech Stack

### Backend
- Developed using **Python**, **TensorFlow**, and **Keras** for building and training the deep learning models.

### Frontend
- Built with **Streamlit**, providing a user-friendly, interactive interface for uploading MRI scans and generating predictions.

### Models
- A pre-trained **Xception model** with transfer learning for high accuracy.
- A custom-built **CNN model** for comparative insights.

### Visualizations
- Powered by **Plotly** for detailed bar charts of class probabilities.
- Utilized **OpenCV** for generating saliency maps to highlight critical areas of the MRI scan.

### LLM Integration
- Incorporated **Gemini**, **Llama**, and **Gemma2** for generating textual explanations and a comprehensive report.
